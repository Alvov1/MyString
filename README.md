# MyString
String class implementation based on standart dynamic char arrays. Analogue of std::string.

Realized multiple constructors, overrided operators and methods. Implemented four types of iterators: forward, const forward, reverse and const reverse. Own exception type for invalid conversions string-to-int and backwards. Search in string based on Aho-Corasick algorithm.
